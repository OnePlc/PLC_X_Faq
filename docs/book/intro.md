Building a module in onePlace can be really simple, once you learn a couple of quirks. 
The goal of this post is to create a faq plugin and introduce you to the basics.

The faq module gives you a starting point for creating any Webbased, data driven
App you can imagine. Want to manage your Contacts, Articles, Faqs, Albums, Worktimes,
Members, whatever you can imagine.
