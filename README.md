## Introduction

This is the Blog Module for onePlace Software Framework based on Laminas Project (former Zend Framework)

## Blog Module

This blog module is a starting point for your own onePlace modules.
It expands on [oneplace-core](https://github.com/OnePlc/PLC_X_Core) and uses the onePlace / Laminas MVC layer and module systems.

## Installation

The easiest way to install onePlace Blog is via composer
```shell script

After installation you can apply a custom sql config.
 
You simply copy the SQL Code from [structure_example_simnple.sql](https://github.com/OnePlc/PLC_X_Blog/tree/master/data/structure_example_simnple.sql]) and [data_example_simnple.sql](https://github.com/OnePlc/PLC_X_Blog/tree/master/data/data_example_simnple.sql]) and run ist on your database.
We also prepared a extended version of a custom SQL config for a better demonstaration of its capability.
