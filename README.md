## Introduction

This is the Faq Module for onePlace Software Framework based on Laminas Project (former Zend Framework)

This modul is based on [oneplace-skeleton](https://github.com/OnePlc/PLC_X_Skeleton) with a few modification to extend its functionality.

In the /data folder you will find usefull custom sql scripts for adding all sorts of additional fields for this specific Faq module.

## Faq Module

This faq module is a starting point for your own onePlace modules.
It expands on [oneplace-core](https://github.com/OnePlc/PLC_X_Core) and uses the onePlace / Laminas MVC layer and module systems.

## Installation

The easiest way to install onePlace Faq is via composer
```shell script
composer require oneplace/oneplace-faq
```
After installation you can apply a custom sql config.
 
You simply copy the SQL Code from [structure_example_simnple.sql](https://github.com/OnePlc/PLC_X_Faq/tree/master/data/structure_example_simnple.sql]) and [data_example_simnple.sql](https://github.com/OnePlc/PLC_X_Faq/tree/master/data/data_example_simnple.sql]) and run ist on your database.
We also prepared a extended version of a custom SQL config for a better demonstaration of its capability.
